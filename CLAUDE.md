# Prop Tracker — notes for Claude

Prop Tracker is a phone-first web app (React + Firebase) for a film production
team's arts department. It is being extended into a click-and-collect system:
creators reserve props, the arts department picks/packs them, everything is logged.

## How to work with the owner (always follow these)

- The owner has almost no coding experience. Claude does the technical work; the
  owner makes the decisions.
- Explain things in plain language. No jargon without a one-line explanation.
- Work in small steps. After each step, say what changed and how the owner can
  see it working themselves.
- Work on a git branch, never directly on `main`. Commit often with clear messages.
- Never delete or overwrite existing prop data. Test against a copy or the
  Firebase emulator, not live data.
- Ask before anything that costs money, deploys to the live site, or changes
  Firebase billing or security rules.
- When a decision belongs to the owner, give 2–3 options with a recommendation,
  then wait.
- When giving the owner commands to run, give the exact command and say what
  success looks like.
- At the end of each phase, update the "Project status" section below in plain
  language so a fresh session can pick up cleanly.
- Each phase: stop, summarize, explain how to test it, wait for the go-ahead.
- Run the automated tests (double-booking + security rules) before calling a
  phase done. Test each phase on a Firebase preview channel before it goes live.
- Ask the owner which email service to use before picking one.
- Out of scope for now: actors, locations, Google Calendar. Do not build these.

## Build plan

1. Foundation: login with two roles (Creator, Arts department/admin), clean prop
   data structure, security rules.
2. Search and prop pages, automatic AI tagging on add.
3. Availability and reservations (date ranges, quantities, lead time, no double-booking).
4. Arts department queue, request statuses, email notifications.
5. Returns, audit trail, damage tracking, late returns.
6. Batch import of 1,000+ props (dry run of 10, review screen, resume, cost cap).

## Project status

- Step 0 (audit) done; no app code changed. Waiting for the owner to approve the
  plan before Phase 1.
- Known issue found in audit: the AI model the app uses for "similar" search
  and prop matching (`text-embedding-004`) was shut down by Google in Jan 2026,
  so those features have been failing silently.
